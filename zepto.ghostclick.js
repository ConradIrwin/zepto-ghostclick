// Handling tap events can be tricky because 300ms after the cycle of
// touchstart, touchmove, touchend events the browser will send a click event
// to the same position on the screen.
//
// Unfortunately, if the DOM of your page has changed by the time this click
// event fires, it can end up hitting a random button instead of the element
// that used to be there.
//
// To fix this, we use a solution suggested by Google: every time there's a
// tap event that our code handles, we prevent any click events that fire in the
// same place shortly afterwards from having any effect.
//
// NOTE: it seems that even though we are cancelling the click event as soon as
// possible, a link that's under the delayed click will still be marked as
// :active for a few tens of milliseconds. I've tried cancelling mousedown
// events too, but that didn't seem to help.
